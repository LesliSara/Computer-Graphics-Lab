### Practice 2

<p style="text-align: left;">
In this practice, we developed a program that performs two main tasks. The first task involved drawing the initials of our names, each rendered in a different color to explore color manipulation and rendering techniques.

The second task focused on creating a 3D house using pyramids and cubes instead of basic triangles and squares. To achieve this, we implemented custom shaders for different colors: red, green, blue, brown, and dark green, avoiding the use of a color clamp shader.

This practice provided a deeper understanding of orthographic vs. perspective projection, highlighting how incorrect Z values in perspective can lead to distorted figures. Additionally, it reinforced key concepts in shaders, transformations, and indexing, particularly in constructing a square-based pyramid.
